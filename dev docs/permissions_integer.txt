How it works:
Each permission has a 2-digit ID, and a permission level with a 1-digit number. For example:
Let's say permission 24 is incentives, and 08 is donations.

242: User can add/remove and view incentives, but cannot change them.
244: User cannot view incentives.
240: User can add/remove, change, and view incentives.

Permissions can be merged together in one number. For example:

241083: User can change and view incentives, but can only view donations.

0 = Add/Remove, Change, View
1 = Change, View
2 = Add/Remove, View
3 = View Only

If the permission is not included in the permission integer, it is assumed that the user/group does not have permission to see the requested resource.

Permission 000 means full access to any part of the dashboard and overrides all other permissions (superuser).
