# donation-tracker
A easy to use and open source donation tracker for speedrunning marathons. Inspired by the GDQ donation tracker but runs in Node. Currently, the tracker is able to collect donations and display them in the console. Work is beginning on the API and backend database. Progress can be tracked on our [projects page](https://github.com/Indiethon/donation-tracker/projects/1). IF you have any suggestions or bugs, please post them in the issue tracker. Thanks!

**This tracker is NOT ready for production yet! It currently is in early development.**

# Help wanted!
This is a big project and I can't do it alone. If you would like to help, please reach out to me on Discord! nicnacnic#5683

More specifically, I would like a front end developer to create the website pages and style them with CSS. Probably going to use React or Vue, idk yet.
