# donation-tracker
A easy to use and open source donation tracker for speedrunning marathons. Inspired by the GDQ donation tracker but runs in Node.

# Help wanted!
This is a big project and I can't do it alone. If you would like to help, please reach out to me on Discord! nicnacnic#5683

More specifically, I would like a front end developer to create the website pages and style them with CSS. Probably going to use React or Vue, idk yet.
